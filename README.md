- New users see the whole chat history.
- When first visiting the site, a random animal nickname and color are assigned to you.
- Your nickname can be changed with `/nick <new nickname>`.
- The color your name appears in can be changed with `/nickcolor RRGGBB`.
- If you close your browser and come back, you'll still have the same nickname and color.
